title: Writing about your team
---

The About section of your website should state what your team does in a clear and user-friendly way.

## This section does not have to be long, but it should address:

* Who you are.

* What you do.

* What your approach is.

* What your mission is.

We find it helpful to pretend you're at a dinner party, sitting next to someone who doesn't know what you do or where you work. If that person says "So what do you do?," how do you explain it?

That's what you want to write in this section.

## Other prompts or phrases that might help:

* Our job is to _____________

* On a daily basis, we work on __________

* We aim to __________

* We work to improve ______

* Our approach is to __________

* We seek to build _________

* Our work matters because ___________

* Our work focuses on ________

* We do this work primarily by ____________

### One tip: Do not use words that may confuse your audience.

If there are phrases or words that may be confusing, it helps to restate those phrases using plain, simple language.

We always recommend reading what you've written out loud to see if it's clear. Better yet, read it to someone who doesn't work with you, and see if they're confused. If they have questions, you can then see if there are clearer ways to say what you mean.

## Examples we like:

* The Gates Foundation has a very concise "What We Do" on [this page](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do).

* The Kickstarter [about page](https://www.kickstarter.com/hello?ref=footer) splits up what to know about the company into seven distinct sections. We like that each section focuses on a particular part of the company's mission.

* The Federal Communications Commission has a very clear and easy to understand [about page](https://www.fcc.gov/what-we-do) which lists how the agency uses its strengths to achieve its mission.
