title: Writing content for your homepage
---

We have compiled a series of tips for writing different sections of your Federalist homepage. The homepage is partioned into four sections: mission statement, announcements, the carousel of facts, and a contact form. We explain what content goes in each section below.

## Mission Statement Section

The top banner section of your website displays a hero image with text across it, with a button that links to another part of your website. 

### Mission Statement

##### Length 

1-2 sentences long

##### Purpose

To describe the mission of your organization. 

Sometimes it helps to think: "If I were describing the mission of where I work to someone at a dinner party," how would I describe that?"

##### Location

The mission statement will be visible at the top-center of your homepage.

### Button Text

##### Length

2-4 words

##### Purpose 

The main button leads people to the number one piece of content on your site that you want people to visit. You want the button text to be an action: "Read more." "Learn more." and "See what we do" are all good options.

##### Location

The button text lives under the mission statement at the top-center of your homepage. 

### Background Image

##### Length

n/a

##### Purpose

The background image on the main page is the first image people will see when they arrive on your site. You want to choose an image that conveys the work you do or illustrate who works within your organization.

##### Location

The background image lives behind the mission statement and the button text at the top of the homepage.

## Announcements section

The second part of your homepage contains an announcements section. This is where you can detail a new report or case study, or talk about a new project or teammate. 

### Feature headline

##### Length 

3-5 words

##### Purpose

The feature headline is the first item people will see on the second second of the homepage: the announcement section. If you're announcing a new research report, you'll want to write something like "Read our Report" or "[Your group name] Releases New Report!" 

##### Location

The feature headline lives in the second part of your homepage, just under the background image containing the mission statement.

### Feature Text

##### Length

2-3 sentences long

##### Purpose

In plain language, you should describe, in plain language, what you're announcing. If you're releasing a new report, you can talk about releasing the new report and what people can find in it.

##### Location

The feature text will live directly under the feature headline, in the second section of the homepage.

### Image

##### Length

n/a

##### Purpose

You can include an image within this section. If you're releasing a report, you could upload a picture of the report cover or an image from the report. If you're announcing a new case study, you can include an image from the case study in this section.

##### Location

The image sits on the left-hand side of the second section of the homepage, directly underneath the feature text.

### Sub-feature text

##### Length

1-2 sentences

##### Purpose

Here, you can write 1-2 sentences that describe the new report you're releasing or the new announcement you're making.

##### Location

This text is to the right of the image, and directly above the feature button.

### Feature Button

##### Length

2-4 words

##### Purpose

The button will take visitors to another part of your website. If you're promoting a research report, this button should say "View our Annual Report" or "Read Our Annual Report" or something like that. If you are using this section for another purpose, use a command or action language on the button. (Words like read, learn, learn more, find out more, etc.) 

## Carousel of Facts Section

The third section of the homepage rotates and showcases other parts of your website. This is the part of your website where you can showcase facts or metrics from reports, case studies, or projects. We recommend starting with four rotating facts in this section. We describe each part of the fact below. Each fact will contain: 

### Carousel Headline

##### Length

One Sentence, statistic or fact. 

##### Purpose

This highlighted section showcases facts from reports, projects, or case studies. You want to put an awesome metric here. Think "Fact that will wow people."

##### Location

This will be the headline in the third section of the homepage.

### Carousel Text

##### Length

One title or phrase

##### Purpose

This should contain the project title that the Carousel Headline came from, or a phrase describing the impact of what's contained in the Carousel Headline.
