title: Writing clear contact forms
---

It's important to have a contact form so that people know how to get in touch with your team.

Before constructing a contact form, it's helpful to answer the following questions.


* What groups are most likely to contact you?

* What will they be contacting you about?

* Do you need different information from each group, depending on their needs?

For example, some people might simply want to receive more information or sign up for a mailing list. It's helpful to know their email address. Others might want to work with your team or for your team. In this case, you'd likely need to ask for more information than an email address.
